# Validation Scoring

For early-stage startups, itâ€™s essential to regularly test assumptions and understand where the strongest signs of traction are emerging. This scoring framework helps evaluate key parts of the offerâ€”such as market demand, pricing fit, and unique valueâ€”based on current evidence. Itâ€™s designed to highlight whatâ€™s working, whatâ€™s still uncertain, and where to focus next to reduce risk and build momentum.

## ðŸ“Š **Scoring Guidelines**

| **Score** | **Meaning** | **Evidence Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 - No validation** | The assumption is untested or contradicted | No supporting evidence. May be based entirely on internal opinion or contradicted by client feedback, research, or market behaviour. |
| **2 - Weak signal** | Some vague or second-hand signal, or mostly untested | Limited anecdotal evidence, weak signals from adjacent markets, or early feedback that is unclear or mixed. Some indications that the assumption may not hold. |
| **3 - Moderate confidence** | Early positive signals, but also open questions | Evidence suggests potential alignment, such as informal client feedback, early interest, or conceptual resonance. However, there may be conflicting inputs or incomplete validation. |
| **4 - Strong validation** | Clear supporting evidence from direct interactions | Direct evidence from client conversations, trials, or behaviour. Multiple data points align with the assumption. Contradicting feedback is minimal or explainable. |
| **5 - Full confidence** | Repeated, consistent, unchallenged validation | Demonstrated through multiple consistent sources: paid engagements, successful pilots, strong conversion rates, or recurring customer behaviour. No meaningful evidence against it. |

## ðŸ“‹ Validation Criteria and Scores

Feel free to adapt this framework to suit specific features, offerings, or customer segmentsâ€”not just entire products. The goal is to guide focus toward areas with the most potential or the highest risk.

| Category | Question | Notes & Evidence | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Market Demand | Does our ideal customer actually exist, and in what numbers? |  |  |
| 2. Access to Market | Can we reliably reach those customers who are both willing and able to pay? | |  |
| 3. Revenue Potential | Is their typical budget enough to support a sustainable business model? |  |  |
| 4. Perceived Credibility | Do they see us as credible and capable of meeting their needs? |  |  |
| 5. Unique Value | What clear, measurable value do we offer compared to alternatives? |  |  |
| 6. Pricing Fit | Do they believe our offer is worth the price we charge? |  |  |
