# Writing Documentation: Guidelines

Our goal is to make documentation easy to read, write, and maintain. The following guidelines help bring consistency and clarity across all documents.

These are not rigid rules—no document needs to be perfect. Think of this as a starting point. What matters most is getting information written down 🙂

## 📌 Formatting Conventions

### ✅ Use backticks (`) for code references

Use backticks for variable names, file names, scripts, executables, and other technical terms.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> `repo_1` contain function_1
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> `repo_1` contains `function_1`

---

### ✅ Keep compound nouns together

Avoid splitting terms that form a single concept.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> This is the link to the `Main`(link here) Repo
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> This is the link to the `Main Repo` (link here)

---

### ✅ Write in third person

Avoid using first-person pronouns.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> I created `repo_1`
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> `repo_1` was created by Masa

---

### ✅ Flag uncertain information

Clearly note anything that needs confirmation.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> `Function_1` might do `outcome_1`
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> `Function_1` does `outcome_1` **(Attention: Requires fact checking)**

---

### ✅ Use bullet points instead of inline lists

Break out multiple items for readability.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> `Executable_1` contains `script_1`, `script_2` and `script_3`
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> `Executable_1` contains the following:
>
> - `script_1`
> - `script_2`
> - `script_3`

---

### ✅ Use one sentence per bullet

Each bullet should contain only one idea.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> `Function_1` performs `outcome_1`. `Function_2` performs `outcome_2`
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> `Function_1` performs `outcome_1`
> `Function_2` performs `outcome_2`

---

### ✅ Use nested bullets for related points

Group related statements for clarity.

> 🔴 **Incorrect**
> `Function_1` performs `outcome_1`
> `Function_1` also performs `outcome_2`
> `Function_2` performs `outcome_3`
>
> 🟢 **Correct**
> `Function_1` performs `outcome_1`
> _It also performs `outcome_2`_
> `Function_2` performs `outcome_3`
